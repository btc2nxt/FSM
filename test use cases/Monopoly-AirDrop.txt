Use Case: Airdrop for Game Monopoly
------------------------------------------

Airdrop for Game Monopoly drops five package coins, every package has 100 coins and situates 
in different coordinate. Players must go to the sites within eight blocks time, otherwise the 
coins will disappear.
Airdrop search from block N+2  to block N+9  when Predistribute FSM ran at block N, then sends 
to collectors who are in the same site with coordinates the Predistribute FSM announced.

@01 ==> @heightRange (7)
@02 ==> @packageAmt (100)
