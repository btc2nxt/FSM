Use Case: Airdrop for Game Monopoly
------------------------------------------

Airdrop for Game Monopoly drops five package coins, every package has 100 coins and situates 
in different coordinate. Players must go to the sites within eight blocks time, otherwise the 
coins will disappear.
Another FSM, that is Distribute for Game Monopoly, which distribute these coins to the players
who are there.
The sites are decided by the last block hash, and different with the last sites.
for example
[1,4]
[11,20]
[35,47]
[66,65]
[99,86]
